# Documentation Reorganization Notice

**📢 The user guides have been moved and integrated into the main documentation!**

## New Locations

The user-focused guides that were previously in this directory have been moved:

- **Main Documentation**: [../README.md](../README.md) - Now contains comprehensive user-focused content
- **Baseline Guide**: [../baseline-guide.md](../baseline-guide.md)
- **Evaluation Guide**: [../evaluation-guide.md](../evaluation-guide.md)
- **Complete Alternative Guide**: [../complete-user-guide.md](../complete-user-guide.md)
- **Documentation Overview**: [../user-guides.md](../user-guides.md)

## What Changed

The feedback about difficult-to-use documentation has been addressed by:

1. **Integrating user guides into main README.md** - The primary entry point now has comprehensive, user-focused workflows
2. **Creating specialized guides** - For users who need deep-dive coverage of specific topics
3. **Adding comprehensive troubleshooting** - Covering common issues and solutions
4. **Reorganizing docs/ folder** - With cleaner structure and better navigation

## For New Users

**Start here**: [Main README](../../README.md)

Choose your path:
- **Complete Model Evaluation** - Comprehensive statistical comparison
- **Test Single Model** - Quick testing of individual models
- **Web Interface Demo** - Interactive testing interface
- **Use Own Dataset** - Evaluate on your own data

## This Directory

This `readmes-todo/` directory is now **deprecated** and can be removed in future cleanup. All user guides have been moved to the main documentation structure.
